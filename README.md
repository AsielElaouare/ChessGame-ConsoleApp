# Chess Game in C# Console App

Overview
This is a simple console-based Chess game written in C# in my free time for fun. It provides a basic implementation of the classic game, allowing two players to make moves on the console. The game follows standard chess rules and includes features such as checking for checkmate, stalemate, and en passant.

Features
Two-player mode: Play against a friend on the same computer.
Standard chess rules: Enforces the basic rules of chess, including piece movements, captures, and special moves like castling and en passant.
Checkmate and stalemate detection: The game checks for checkmate and stalemate conditions to determine the end of the game.
